autofillCityStateMagentoAdmin
=============================

*Bookmarklet* to autofill the city and state based on zipcode in Magento Admin. 

<object width="420" height="315"><param name="movie" value="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/vOGydkJsrx4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/vOGydkJsrx4?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="420" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

### Use case 
This can be helpful for customer service agents while taking orders from customers over the phone. Saves time as they don't have to type in the city and state names.

### How to Use
* Add the bookmarklet to the bookmarks bar in your browser. 
* When creating an order in Magento Admin, type in zipcode as usual and then, click the bookmarklet.
* The city and state will be auto filled.

*Note:* for now, this bookmarklet works just for cities and states in the United States.
