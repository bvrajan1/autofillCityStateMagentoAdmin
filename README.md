This can be helpful for customer service agents while taking orders from customers over the phone. Saves time as they don't have to type in the city and state names.

### How to Use
* Add the bookmarklet to the bookmarks bar in your browser. 
* When creating an order in Magento Admin, type in zipcode as usual and then, click the bookmarklet.
* The city and state will be auto filled.

*Note:* for now, this bookmarklet works just for cities and states in the United States.
